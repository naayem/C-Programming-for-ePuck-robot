# Robotics University Project - ePuck Robot Programming

## Project Overview
This university project involves programming an ePuck robot, a compact, two-wheeled robot equipped with various sensors. We aim to creatively utilize the robot's features through different modes like Pong game simulation and Alphabet writing.

## Requirements
- ePuck robot with motors, microphones, camera, proximity sensors, and LEDs.
- Development environment for ePuck with necessary libraries.

## Features
1. **Pong Game Simulation:** The robot plays a pong game within virtual boundaries, reacting to virtual walls and keeping score.
2. **Alphabet Writing Mode:** Moves in patterns to write letters.
3. **Mapping and Position Tracking:** Tracks its position and orientation.
4. **Sensor Integration:** Uses proximity sensors, camera, and microphones.
5. **LED Management:** Uses LEDs for feedback and interaction.
6. **Serial and USB Communication:** For debugging and commands.
7. **Error Handling and System Management:** Ensures smooth operation.

## How to Run
1. **Compile the Code:** Include all libraries and compile for ePuck.
2. **Upload to ePuck:** Use tools to upload the program to ePuck.
3. **Operate Modes:** Use commands or button presses on ePuck to switch modes.

## Code Structure
- **main.h:** Main header with libraries and function prototypes.
- **game_management.h:** Manages game modes and state transitions.
- **audio_processing.h, microphone.h:** For audio processing.
- **camera_processing.h:** Handles camera image processing.
- **ir_thread.h, proximity.h:** Manages IR sensors for proximity detection.
- **motors_processing.h:** Controls motor movements.
- **leds.h:** Manages LED states.

## Development Notes
- **Testing:** Test each feature thoroughly in a controlled environment.
- **Modifications:** Code structured for easy modifications and future expansions.
- **Debugging:** Use serial outputs for debugging and monitoring.
